# Codecademy - Data Science Foundations Skill Path

This is the main repo for a selection of the projects and porfolio projects that are included in this skill path. They are a combination of completed and in-progress. 

Most of them are supplied by Codecademy in Jupyter Notebook format and I have completed them in that format. 

Each folder seperates the projects by topic and the projects that can be found in each folder are as follows:

### Python_Lists:
frida_project

### Python_String_Methods
coded_correspondence

### Python_Dictionaries
hurricane_analysis

medical_insurance
